            work in progress as you might infer from the erratic, amateurish styling. My goal is 
            for the visible layout and also the underlying code structure to steadily become more 
            coherent and refined while I progress through the boot camp and acquire a better 
            understanding of helpful techniques. Please let the disoriented amalgamation 
            you're witnessing serve as an inspiring reminder that we must first endure 
            being awful at an activity until we gradually gain proficiency resulting from 
            persistent effort.
